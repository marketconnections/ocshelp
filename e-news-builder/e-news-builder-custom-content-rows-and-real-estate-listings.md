# E-News Builder: Custom Content Rows and Real Estate Listings

The ENEWS Builder supports any kind of additional content you want to provide.

The way Emails are structured is in Rows and Columns. First you add a Row with a set number of Columns to the email. Then you add Content Blocks into those Columns.

### How-To <a id="how-to"></a>

* You can add new Rows of content by clicking on the `Rows` tab of the Tool bar on the right side of the window.
* Figure out how many columns you want to display. Then drag the row icon into your email.
* Now add a Content Block by clicking on the `Content` tab of the Tools bar on the right side of the window.
* Choose any kind of element and drag it into the empty placeholder of the Row you added above.
* You can then customize the content to your liking by typing text, or dragging and dropping images.
