# Navigating OCS

After you login to OCS, you'll see the Dashboard, as well as a Navigation Pane on the left we call the NavBar, and a Profile Menu on the top right.  

The Dashboard may show a Welcome message when you login for the first time. You may also see promotions or other messages from Market Connections.

## Navigation

1. The **Dashboard** link in the **NavBar** will always bring you back to the main dashboard page
2. The **Active Products** section of the NavBar displays all the products for which you have an active subscription or order. There may only be one product listed here, or you might subscribe to several of our products. Each product has it's own links.
3. Click on a Product name, such as "**Realty Report"** or "**RealtyReport Online"** to view the submenu of **Services** available for that product.
4. The **Inactive Products** section shows the products you used to take, but have cancelled, or which may be inactive.  You may not see anything here if you don't have inactive products with us.  The inactive products section shows a subset of the Services that are available in the Active products section.
5. The **Collapse Widget** allows you to shrink the **NavBar** down to give you more screen width
6. The **Notifications Menu** displays alerts. You may be prompted that your Mailing List or Layout requires approval, for instance.
7. The **Profile Menu** allows you to **Logout** of OCS. It also displays links to your Profile page, where you can.
